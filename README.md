# genome_metadata_optimization
Genome Metadata Optimization for the SDSC

This repository is composed of 3 main jupyter notebooks. Two are user oriented and one is an explanation of the reasoning behind the elaboration of this optimization solution.

For all notebooks, if the repository structure is preserved (with *genome_metadata* and its 3 subfolders, *FASTA_files*, *metadata*, and *scripts*), they can be run as such.

**Reasoning explanations:** 
- SDSC_Genome_metadata_storage_optimization:
Here there are ready to run examples. There are also some explanations about conception choices as well as Future possibilities of development of the project.

**User oriented: (user profile, coder or non-coder knowledgeable to run a jupyter notebook)**
- SDSC_New_Metadata:
Here the user can input new metadata for a FASTA file he/she/they have added to the *FASTA_files* folder of the repository. The procedure aims to be self explanatory inside the notebook. It ensures quality checks and standardization of naming.

- SDSC_Edit_Metadata:
Here the user can edit metadata or extract metadata. The edit applies to the naming of the FASTA file, and to changing the values for the different metadata fields. The extract can be performed for an entire metadata or for specific metadata files, fulfilling a criteria.
